# sqlite2ical
sqlite2ical converts iPhone sqlite format calendars to iCal/vCal/ICS format.
Download the compiled sqlite2ical here: http://cl.ly/1v1Q413G0Z3p3k0M0p08

As a bonus, this copy of sqlite2ical comes with a precompiled copy of libical with i386 and ARM architectures (works perfectly for iPhone development).

## Usage
sqlite2ical <input.sqlitedb> <output.ics>

## Note
sqlite2ical will not currently convert recurring events. Feel free to fork the project and add it in if you'd like!

## License
sqlite2ical is intended for personal use. If you intend to use it for anything else (i.e. in your own piece of software, etc.), let me know.
